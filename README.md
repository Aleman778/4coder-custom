# Aleman778's Personal 4coder Custom Layer (still WIP)
My custom layer for the awesome text editor 4coder beta version 4.1.7 super!
This is still work-in-progress and you should expect some bugs, I have
been using these for quite some time now and it is relatively stable.

## Installation
Note that you need the paid version of 4coder to enable customizations.
1. `cd path/to/4coder/custom`
2. `git clone https://github.com/Aleman778/4coder_aleman.git`
3. `cd 4coder_aleman`
4. - Windows: `build.bat`
   - Mac Os: `./build_mac.sh`
   - Linux: `./build_linux.sh`

## Keybindings
The default keybindings are loosely based on to the `xah-fly-keys` which are explained
here <http://ergoemacs.org/misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html>.
