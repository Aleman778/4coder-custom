# My 4coder custom layer (currently WIP)
My custom layer for the awesome text editor 4coder beta version 4.1.7 super!
Installation is simple all you need to do is download the sources and place
them inside your 4coder `custom` folder and compile the executable.
For compiling the executable there already exists build scripts for each platform and
target architecture, for example you can call this inside the 4coder root directory:
```
custom\bin\buildsuper_x64-win.bat custom\4coder_aleman_bindings.cpp
```
Before compiling make sure that the editor is closed and that your working directory
is the 4coder root i.e. same directory as the `4ed` executable.

## Keybindings
The default keybindings are loosely based on to the `xah-fly-keys` which are explained
here <http://ergoemacs.org/misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html>.
