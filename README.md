# My 4coder custom layer
My custom layer for the awesome text editor 4coder beta version 4.1.7 super!
Installation is simple just put the files in your `custom` directory and run the provided 
build script on the file `4coder_alexander.cpp` like this
```
custom\bin\buildsuper_x64-win.bat custom\4coder_alexander.cpp
```
Of course change the build script depending on your operating system and target processor architecture.
